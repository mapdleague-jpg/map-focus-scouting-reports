    <!-- OVERVIEW -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Ashley stands out as one of the most polished sophomore prospects in the Pro Bowl cohort — academically exceptional 
            at Cornell Dyson (4.04 GPA), Division I fencer, and multi-track MAP alum with tangible technical exposure across IB, PE, 
            leveraged finance, credit and S&T. Her communication quality, structure in deliverables, and clarity under pressure are 
            consistently high-signal. Ashley arrives prepared, performs with composure, and submits clean work — she is the type of 
            athlete who executes above expectation when stakes rise.
        </p>
        <p>
            A returning MAP athlete, she has repeatedly shown reliability in sprint windows, producing well-formatted written outputs, 
            financial reasoning with executive tone, and strong synthesis of deal-relevant information. Her maturity and technical 
            literacy make her an early favorite for competitive 2026 pipelines.

    <!-- DEVELOPMENT -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>Development Areas</h2>
        <p>
            Continued progression will come from expanding advanced modeling depth — moving into full LBO buildouts, operating case 
            sensitivities, and memo drafting with more scenario ranges. IB5 score indicates opportunity to sharpen multi-variable reasoning 
            under time pressure, which is common at this level and expected to accelerate quickly given her work ethic and existing foundation.

    <!-- PROJECTION -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>Outlook & Projection</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Day-one internship contributor.</strong> Ashley is a clear high-probability IB placement and a top sophomore candidate for 
            deal-driven roles across M&A, PE, or credit. She already operates with intern-ready professionalism, demonstrates poise that 
            translates well to client-facing environments, and brings execution habits sponsors trust. Expect upward velocity — a likely 
            summer analyst as early as 2026 with potential for buy-side conversion long term.
